			<div class="copy_01"data-rellax-speed="-5">Ryan McGinness is a New York-based visual artist whose large scale paintings draw heavy
				influence from the surf and skate culture of his hometown of Virginia Beach, Virginia. Known for his
				intricately layered pieces, McGinness weaves together the visual language
				<br>of contemporary iconography,
				corporate logos, and public signage, creating abstract pieces that have established him as one of the most
				popular artists of his generation.

			The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, VA first teamed up with  <br>McGinness
			for their official reopening in May of 2010, commissioning <br>the artist to create a
			monumental and site-specific installation piece.
			<br>Entitled Art History Is Not Linear (VMFA),
			and inspired by
			pieces from
			<br>the museum’s archives, McGinness’ work is on permanent display in
			<br>the museum. Now, four years later, McGinness returns to the VMFA for
			<br>RyanMcGinness: Studio Visit, an exhibit that presents a unique view of
			<br>thecreative process behind this massivecommissioned work. Partnering
			<br>with the VMFA, we stepped inside his studio to talk to the artist about
			<br>theevolution of his work.
